# Loan Approval Prediction

A machine learning pipeline to predict loan approval for applicants based on demographic, income, credit_history, and property area features. Implemented in a Jupyter notebook with end‑to‑end steps from data loading through model evaluation.

## 📈 Project Overview

This project builds a classification model to determine whether a loan application will be approved. Key objectives are to explore and clean the raw data, engineer relevant features, train multiple classifiers, and select the best model for deployment.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: Public loan dataset (e.g., Kaggle “Loan Prediction” dataset)  
- **Features** include:  
  - `Gender`, `Married`, `Dependents`, `Education`, `Self_Employed`  
  - `ApplicantIncome`, `CoapplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`, `Loan_Amount_Term`  
  - `Credit_History`, `Property_Area`  
- **Target**: `Loan_Status` (Y = Approved, N = Rejected)

> ⚠️ Place the CSV file (`train.csv`) in the project root before running the notebook.

---

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

### Create a virtual environment & install dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Loan_Approval_Prediction.ipynb
```

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Loading & EDA**  
   - Read CSV into pandas DataFrame  
   - Visualized distributions and missing-value patterns  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Imputed missing values (median for numeric, mode for categorical)  
   - Encoded categorical variables (One‑Hot / Label Encoding)  
   - Engineered `Total_Income = ApplicantIncome + CoapplicantIncome`  

3. **Feature Scaling**  
   - Applied StandardScaler to numeric features  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Trained and compared:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Tree Classifier  
     - Random Forest Classifier  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1‑Score, ROC‑AUC  
   - Plotted ROC curves and confusion matrices

## 📊 Modeling & Results

| Model                   | Accuracy | ROC‑AUC |
|-------------------------|---------:|--------:|
| Logistic Regression     | 78.2%    | 0.81    |
| Decision Tree           | 75.6%    | 0.78    |
| **Random Forest (Best)**| **82.5%**| **0.86**|

The Random Forest classifier delivered the highest performance, achieving an **82.5%** accuracy and **0.86** ROC‑AUC on the test set.

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run all notebook cells to reproduce analysis and model training.  
2. Modify hyperparameters or add new classifiers in the **Modeling** section.  
3. Export final model for deployment (e.g., with `joblib.dump()`).

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV  
- Incorporate additional features (credit score, employment length)  
- Develop a REST API using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions  
- Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit / Dash) for end users
